âœ… Converting a React app into a pure HTML, CSS & JS project is doable â€” but keep in mind:

React apps depend on JSX + build tooling.

In a pure project, you wonâ€™t have JSX or components â€” youâ€™ll write plain HTML and DOM manipulation.

Any React logic must be replaced with vanilla JavaScript equivalents.

Hereâ€™s a clear plan for you ðŸ‘‡

ðŸ”· Step 1: Analyze the React App
Locate your React app source code:
Typically under /src

Identify:

JSX templates â†’ these will become your HTML.

CSS (in /src or /public) â†’ these remain CSS files.

JavaScript (state, props, event handlers) â†’ these will become vanilla JS scripts.

ðŸ”· Step 2: Prepare the New Project Structure
You can start with a basic folder structure:

perl
Copy
Edit
my-app/
â”œâ”€â”€ index.html
â”œâ”€â”€ style.css
â”œâ”€â”€ app.js
â”œâ”€â”€ assets/ (images, fonts, etc.)
You can keep /assets for all your images, icons, fonts from your React app's /public.

ðŸ”· Step 3: Replace JSX With HTML
Open your React components and convert JSX to plain HTML.

React uses className â†’ in HTML itâ€™s just class.

Self-closing tags need /> in JSX, but in HTML most are fine (<img>, <br>).

Reactâ€™s dynamic rendering ({}) needs to become DOM manipulation in JS.

Example:
React component:

jsx
Copy
Edit
function App() {
  return (
    <div className="app">
      <h1>Hello {name}</h1>
    </div>
  );
}
Becomes:

html
Copy
Edit
<div class="app">
  <h1 id="greeting"></h1>
</div>
and in app.js:

js
Copy
Edit
const name = "World";
document.getElementById("greeting").textContent = Hello ${name};
ðŸ”· Step 4: Copy Over Styles & Assets
Copy your CSS files into style.css (adjust paths if necessary).

Copy /public assets (like images, icons) into /assets.

ðŸ”· Step 5: Rewrite Interactivity in JS
Anything using:

useState â†’ use a JS variable + DOM updates.

useEffect â†’ run your JS when the page loads or based on events.

onClick, onChange â†’ attach event listeners manually:

js
Copy
Edit
document.getElementById("myBtn").addEventListener("click", () => {
  // do something
});
ðŸ”· Step 6: Test
Open index.html in your browser.

Check console for errors.

Fix path issues (./assets/..., etc.).

Make sure all scripts run after DOM is loaded:

js
Copy
Edit
document.addEventListener("DOMContentLoaded", () => {
  // your JS code
});
Optional: Automate with a Template
Hereâ€™s a minimal index.html you can adapt:

html
Copy
Edit
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
<meta charset="UTF-8">
<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
<title>My App</title>
<link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css">
</head>
<body>

<div class="app">
  <h1 id="greeting"></h1>
</div>

<script src="app.js"></script>
</body>
</html>
ðŸš€ Notes:
React handles a lot (virtual DOM, routing, etc.) â€” you may need more vanilla JS to replicate those.

If your app is complex (e.g. SPA with routing), consider a small library like htmx or write basic client-side routing yourself.
